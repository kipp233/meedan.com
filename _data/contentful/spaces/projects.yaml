    body: |
      In April 2019 Meedan worked with newsrooms and fact checking organizations on three election initiatives in some of Asia’s largest democracies. Our award-winning fact-checking platform, Check, was at the center of each of the digital verification projects.

      Newsrooms around the world use Check for digital verification, investigations, election monitoring and other large scale journalism projects. Now in our third year of working with local partners and reporting networks on five continents, our simultaneous initiatives in India, Indonesia and the Philippines showed the versatility and robustness of the Check platform. Each project was unique, and called for a personalized approach to news collaboration.

      ## Check in India

      In November 2018, our newsroom collaboration program “Pop-Up Newsroom” ran a two-day workshop with journalists and fact checkers in India. The goal of the workshop was to design a collaborative initiative that would help us better understand and address misinformation surrounding the world’s largest exercise in democracy: India’s general election. Workshop participants raised misinformation on WhatsApp as a challenge in need of urgent attention. WhatsApp plays a [significant role in elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/technology/whatsapp-india-elections.html) in many developing countries, and in recent years WhatsApp-based rumors in India have caused misinformation issues that in some cases led to [violence and death](https://www.wired.com/story/how-whatsapp-fuels-fake-news-and-violence-in-india/).

      ![A snapshot of Check in action in India](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/7ByjlM8ANw0DQKaFgilv7k/75663509b60dee23c990ceea2696068a/check-in-india.png)

      In response to those concerns, Meedan partnered with Pop-Up Newsroom, WhatsApp and the civic media studio Proto on a massive and innovative research endeavour that looked at misinformation circulating on WhatsApp.

      The recently launched [Whatsapp Business API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview) allows companies like Meedan to integrate Whatsapp into existing software systems. We brought the API into Check, which allowed the Proto team to use Check as the command center for the initiative. In April the collaboration, [Checkpoint](https://www.checkpoint.pro.to/), was officially launched. It used the WhatsApp Business API integration to conduct research to better understand misinformation spreading on the messaging platform.

      ![Screenshots showing how the Check integration with the WhatsApp Business API supported Checkpoint in India.](//images.ctfassets.net/g118h5yoccvd/ZGSXEbcYFFi7s3hNd9W22/7f47387810303d1f82b917a12807cea4/meedan-in-asia_checkpoint-india.jpeg)

      Pamposh Raina, a researcher working with Proto said, “A lot of people who are working in this space have a feeling that this election had a lot of misinformation…This was the right time to think of a large project that could focus on WhatsApp especially, and look at that role.”

      In total, Checkpoint gathered over 80,000 claims for verification. The findings of the research will be available in the coming months. For more about Checkpoint, [click here](https://medium.com/@meedan/press-release-new-whatsapp-tip-line-launched-to-understand-and-respond-to-misinformation-during-f4fce616adf4).

      ## Check in Indonesia

      In Indonesia, the Google News Initiative worked with our Pop-Up Newsroom program to help journalism schools, newsrooms and fact checking organizations collaborate to verify claims during and leading up to Indonesia’s election. The initiative was headed by the fact-checking platform Cekfakta. Check was used as the workbench for the election-day newsroom collaboration. “It was hectic, but we had a sense that we were in good hands and obviously Fergus and Tom knew what they were doing, they’ve helped many elections before ours,” said Meedan partner Wahyu Dhyatmika, editor-in-chief of the Indonesian media outlet Tempo.co and director of Cekfakta.

      Similar to Meedan’s 2016 Electionland newsroom in the United States, journalism students acted as first responders during the Indonesian election project, scanning and checking for the first signs of online misinformation or social media users reporting problems in the voting process. When the students found suspicious claims, they passed those tips along to reporters for further investigation. It was a multi-tiered effort that required seamless communication during a rapidly evolving news event.

      > “[Check] was the platform we used to collaborate on [election] day. We had our own CMS and our own platform, but it was lacking in terms of managing live factchecking. I think that was solved by Check. Without that I cannot imagine how we could have worked.” - Wahyu Dhyatmika.

      ## Check in the Philippines

      The collaborative fact-checking initiative Tsek.ph saw three journalism schools and 11 media partners working together to produce about 100 fact checks about the 2019 election in the Philippines.

      The inspiration for this project came from previous election collaborations, including CrossCheck in France and Verificado in Mexico (both of which also used Check as the central hub for collaboration).
      “We said it would be great to use Check for the same [type of] collaboration. So it was not difficult to convince anyone [to use Check as our] claim management system,” said Yvonne Chua, the co-founder of the Meedan partner Vera Files.

      In the end, it was the students of the University of the Philippines that verified the most claims. “The University used Check to its fullest. On election day we saw their collaboration, how they put in the claims, how we fact checked the claims, everything, all our work was within the Check platform,” said Chua.

    body: "While misinformation is not a new problem, what’s new is the context: as
      misinformation flows online, it’s pretty clear we need structures for signaling
      content credibility. The need for a common framework has long been in discussion,
      since [this post](https://medium.com/meedan-updates/lies-algorithms-and-journalists-2cf10104dbe2)
      published just after our experience at Meedan monitoring the 2016 election,
      to the early days of MisinfoCon. [In a blog post we crafted in March 2017](https://misinfocon.com/building-technical-standards-for-credibility-59ef9ee4ab73)
      before we founded the [Credibility Coalition](http://www.credibilitycoalition.org/)
      (CredCo), we argued for the importance of standards:\n\n> As concerns grow about
      the importance of establishing credible content, so do concerns about how this
      credibility is communicated on content traveling around the web. Simply rating
      an article as “credible” is not enough; we need to understand what parts of
      it are credible, how the conclusion about its credibility was reached, and how
      to communicate that credibility effectively…. Defining a set of standards for
      content credibility gives us a more effective way to talk about it, and, importantly,
      to make important decisions about how we share and display that content, regardless
      of what site the content appears on.\n \nSince then, CredCo has grown as an
      initiative with Hacks/Hackers, and we helped form the W3C Credible Web Community
      group (CredWeb). [Founded last year at the W3C’s annual plenary](https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/wiki/2017-11-08-minutes)
      (yes, that means means we’re celebrating our birthday today!), at CredWeb pleased
      to release two documents for public review and commentary. These are both DRAFT
      documents, designed to be circulated and commented on by folks dedicating time
      to this issue.\n\n#### [Technological Approaches to Improving Credibility Assessment
      on the Web](https://credweb.org/report/20181011)\n\nThis is a vision document
      that captures a general technical approach for improving credibility assessment
      online. It captures everything from terminology to threat models and stakeholders,
      and it lays out some of our core vision for the potential of these standards.
      It’s a hefty lift, and we recommend taking some time to look through it and
      offer commentary.\n\nHere’s how it starts:\n\n*Can you tell, when looking at
      a random web page, whether you should trust it? When scanning a page of reviews
      or search results, do you know which matches come from legitimate sources and
      which are scams? When reading a news feed, can you tell which items ought to
      be believed and which are slanted or manipulative? Can you detect propaganda
      or outright lies? Perhaps most importantly, what happens when you inevitably
      guess wrong while making some of these credibility assessments, and you unknowingly
      share falsehoods with your community, helping to make them viral? What if you
      are misled into making bad decisions for yourself and the people you care about,
      with potentially disastrous consequences?*\n\n*The Credible Web Community Group
      was formed at W3C, the organization which develops technical standards for the
      web, to look for technological approaches to this “credibility assessment” problem.
      It’s not that we think technology can solve every problem, especially ones as
      deeply human and complex as this one, but it seems likely that some technology
      is making matters worse and that certain designs could probably serve people
      better. For some of us, creating better approaches to credibility assessment
      seems like a good way to help.*\n\n\n#### [Credibility Signals](https://credweb.org/signals/)\n\nAfter
      reading through the above, it helps to dive into specifics. What do signals
      look like? In this document, we have an outline of some draft signals. They
      range from signals around rhetoric — does it show negative or positive valence?
      — to a typology around clickbait and what it means for a title to accurately
      represent the body content.\n\nHere’s how we frame the document:\n\n*This document
      is intended to support an ecosystem of interoperable credibility tools. These
      software tools, which may be components of familiar existing systems, will gather,
      process, and use relevant data to help people more accurately decide what information
      they can trust online and protect themselves from being misled. We expect that
      an open data-sharing architecture will facilitate efficient research and development,
      as well as an overall system which is more visibly trustworthy.*\n\n*The document
      has three primary audiences:*\n\n- *Software developers and computer science
      researchers wanting to build systems which work with credibility data. For them,
      the document aims to be a precise technical specification, stating what they
      need for their software to interoperate with any other software which conforms
      to this specification.*\n- *People who work in journalism and want to review
      and contribute to this technology sphere, to help make sure it is beneficial
      and practical.*\n- *Non-computer-science researchers, interested in helping
      develop and improve the science behind this work.*\n\nWe’re grateful to the
      many many participants who gave feedback on these documents in their early stages,
      and we’re looking forward to advancing them in our second year as a group. If
      you’re coming to [CredCon](http://www.credcon.org/), be sure to join our workshops
      and chat with CredWeb co-chair Sandro Hawke. Or, learn more about joining the
      group at [credweb.org](http://credweb.org/).\n\n\n\n\n"

      Using real-time data from weather events is essential input when designing a project that will serve journalists hoping to cover these types of stories through an editorial collaboration. Through our fellowship program with the Reynolds Journalism Institute, University of Missouri, we enlisted the help of Rachel Behrndt — a Mizzou journalism student — to try and identify some key takeaways from the way this story was covered. She spent hours watching real-time coverage and pouring through stories from this storm in order to give our project some valuable insights:

      ### 1. Collaboration is already happening at some level

      We observed several reports that indicated that collaboration and content sharing was already happening between some media organizations in their coverage of Florence. For example, The Charlotte Observer posted an article in which the text was all original content from the Charlotte Observer, and the article was supplemented by video content from WBTV. Due to the difference in format and audience, WBTV isn’t in direct competition with The Charlotte Observer, and this shows a willingness to collaborate and share information and content with other journalists.

      ### 2. There are obvious areas where resources can be pooled more efficiently

      Another area where there is potential for collaboration is the resources that journalists are using for newsgathering. Right now, the official sources journalists are using are similar — if not the same — across many different outlets. We observed many quotes from the National Hurricane Center and the governor’s office of North Carolina, for example. This suggests pooling the collection of such quotes and interviews, which are repetitions and duplicative, may be one area where coordination could help both newsrooms and public information officers. Where information/resources were lacking was in interviews and quotes from real people affected by the storm. Through a universal guide for gathering and finding resources, it may be easier for different outlets to get diverse points of view, which will enrich original reporting. This leads into the next area in which information can be gathered and used to make coverage more diverse and all-encompassing, through the use of user-generated content and social media….

      ### 3. Duplication needs to be limited to more effectively serve audiences

      With most newsrooms, and in particular newsrooms in small and mid-markets, running on extremely scarce resources, avoiding the duplication of work can be a key benefit of collaboration. This suggests giving newsrooms a way to collaborate on duplicative tasks, for example in the discovery, verification and acquisition of user-generated content, can have a strong positive impact for both newsrooms and audiences. This could potentially allow stations and newspapers to better report the effect the storm is having on their specific coverage area, with more original and in-depth reporting. Additionally, with a more open sharing of information, stations will be able to have access to a greater range of UGC to incorporate into their coverage. office. __During times of crisis, exclusivity of information could keep victims of the storm from vital information. Sharing this information not only enriches coverage but could keep people safe in times of disaster.__

      ### 4. Not every part of a story is competitive

      The basic data and information regarding a natural disaster should not be an area on which newsrooms compete — the importance of this information to the wider public is too great, and the cost of duplicating basic the gathering of this data is too high. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to share all your information with your direct competitor. However, having a common database of information in which stations around the affected state can have access to things like UGC as well as information from official sources will allow audiences across the country to better understand the storm, its path, and the effect it might have.

      ### 5. Branding builds trust and profile

      Because weather is such an important coverage area for many local and mid-market media, effective branding plays a key role in building trust and audience loyalty. For example, the weather desks of stations often have a piece of equipment which they market, such as a Dallas NBC affiliate “The Thunder Truck.” With a shared stream of data and UGC, we can see a potentially valuable and trustworthy “brand” that asserts membership to a reporting collaboration, and access to a wider range of data and content. This brand can be a new area of distinction for newsrooms that participate in the collaboration and the sharing of non-competing content, information and data.
