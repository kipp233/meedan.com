            <p>We created some <a href="https://github.com/meedan/check/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest">GitHub issues for Hacktoberfest</a>. All the issues have labels identifying the Check component it is related to, the difficulty level and the technology knowledge needed to work with the issue. Choose one issue to work on or suggest a new issue.</p>
            <p>Start contributing to a new open source project can seem confusing or difficult. <a href="https://github.com/meedan/check/wiki">Check documentation</a> will help you understand Check and orient your first steps.</p>
